<p>VistA natively supports RPC transport to expose Remote Procedure calls to a variety of Clients such as CPRS.
While VistA RPC is an efficient, stable, and broadly adapted protocol within the VistA community, interoperability with other systems requires the ability to mediate RPC with other industry standard protocols at both the transport and data format layers.
In addition, business level interoperability requires addressing standards around security and identity management using open standards.
This recording discusses using OSS Apache technology to provide secure mediation between existing VistA RPC applications and external applications using HL7.</p>
