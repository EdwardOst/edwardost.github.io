<p>This is the first in a series of posts documenting learning VistA.
The goal is to become modestly proficient with VistA so that we can stand up a working VistA instance.
We will then use open source integration technology from Apache to connect VistA to other enterprise functionality, whether in the cloud or on-premise.
This connectivity is provided using an Apache <a href="https://github.com/OSEHRA/vista-soa-ri">Camel VistA connector</a>.</p>

<h2 id="vista-distribution">VistA Distribution</h2>

<p>We originally started with the baseline <a href="http://www.osehra.org/">OSEHRA</a> distribution.
However, we soon found that the the OSEHRA distribution of VistA is more of a bare-bones installation.
It requires installation and configuration of many packages.
While it provides the core packages, it is not really a distribution that is appropriate for beginner VistA users.</p>

<p>After looking around a bit and getting some very valuable input from more experienced users (big thanks to Chris Uyehara), we settled on <a href="http://worldvista.org/">WorldVistA</a> as a mature and stable distribution that is pure open source.
I would make the analogy of OSEHRA VistA as building your own Linux distribution from the kernel and core unix libraries, whereas WorldVistA is a ready-made shrink wrapped version that you can install and run similar to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I was able to easily <a href="http://worldvista.org/Software_Download">download WorldVistA</a> on my windows Machine and then followed the instructions for the Cache version.
I used the single user Cache license since I wanted the easiest possible user experience.
However, Cache is ultimately not open source.
GTM provides an open source alternative, and I will probably try that with WorldVistA on Linux OS with GTM in the near future.</p>

<p>Everything went smoothly for the most part.
The one note I would make for Windows users is to be sure to install Cache with Administrator privileges.</p>

<p>In my case I wanted to test the Camel VistA connector running as a proxy between a VistA server and a VistA client.
WorldVistA also provides a download for a <a href="http://worldvista.org/Software_Download/worldvista_ehr_v2_clients">CPRS</a> client.
After installing and launching Taskman, RPC Broker, and Mailman; I was able to connect with CPRS to the WorldVistA RPC Broker on the default 9211 port.</p>

<h2 id="camel-vista-proxy">Camel-VistA Proxy</h2>

<p>At this point I introduced the Camel VistA proxy.
I made a copy of the CPRS shortcut so that I could modify the commandline parameters of the CPRS client to point to the Camel-VistA proxy on port 9201.
The camel proxy was then connecting to VistA on the original port (9211).</p>

<p>I encountered problems when I tried to connect from CPRS through the proxy because it turns out that there is a new version of the RPC Broker in the current release of WorldVistA.
The new RPC client is also used by CPRSv28, which is available via WorldVistA as well.
The new RPC Broker adds support for a variety of useful things like being able to connect through firewalls.
WorldVistA server supoprts both old and new RPC broker configurations for backward compatibility with older clients, e.g. previous versions of CPRS.
The WorldVistA CPRSv28 distribution is also backward compatible with the old RPC broker, so it successfully negotiated even with the old RPC broker.
But the Camel-VistA connector is only designed to work with the  new version of RPC Broker.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my working copy of WorldVistA had defaulted to starting the old RPC Broker.
Fortunately, the WorldVistA community helped me resolve this issue quickly (big thanks to Nancy Anthracite and Joel Ivey).</p>

<h2 id="rpc-broker-configuration">RPC Broker Configuration</h2>

<p>You probaby wonâ€™t need to do this yourself, since the community has already fixed it.
But perhaps you will need to support both old and new RPC Broker clients and this will be helpful.
Just in case here it is.
I have placed double asterisks aroudn the text that I entered.</p>

<h3 id="quick-summary">Quick Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Connect to VistA with Terminal</li>
  <li>Verify Version of RPC Broker</li>
  <li>Start RPC Broker Logging</li>
  <li>Configure the RPC Broker Listener</li>
  <li>Start the RPC Broker</li>
  <li>Verify Version of RPC Broker</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verify-version-of-rpc-broker">Verify Version of RPC Broker</h3>

<p>Use System Status command and look for the port number of your configured RPC Broker.
The default port for WorldVistA is 9211 shown in bold below.
If the Routine is XWBTCPL then it is the <strong>OLD</strong> listener.
If the Routine is %ZISTCPS then is the <strong>NEW</strong> listener.</p>

<p>To view the RPC log, you will need to look at the RPC Broker logs.
Be sure that you scroll through any old log records.
Optionally, you may wish to delete all the old logs prior to starting up your new RPC broker instance.</p>
