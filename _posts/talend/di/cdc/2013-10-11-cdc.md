Change data capture is easy to use in Talend Studio.  Here is a short eight minute video for [CDC] that will show you what you need to get started.

You can find documentation and a step-by-step example for CDC in the [Component Reference Guide] at help.talend.com.

The sample [CRM schema] and [DWH schema] as well as the [sample jobs] are available.  Load the sample jobs into the integration perspective using Import Items.

The use case starts by generating a common set of data and replicating it to two sample databases in mysql, CRM and DWH.

The CDC subscription is then created in Talend Studio.  These steps are shown in the video.

After the subscription is created, changes are made to the CRM database.

Finally, changes are replicated to the DWH.
