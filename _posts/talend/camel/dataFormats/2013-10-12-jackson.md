Camel has many [data formats] including support for [JSON marshalling].  In fact Camel supports three different libraries for JSON marshalling: Jackson, Xstream, and GSON.

This post will show you how to use Jackson with Talend Studio.  To use the Camel Jackson data format you need to add the <tt>camel-jackson-alldep-2.10.4.jar</tt> dependency to your route using the <tt>cConfig</tt> component.  The version number should match whatever version of camel you are using.  In Talend 5.3.1 we use Camel 2.10.4.

To **unmarshal** from JSON to POJO use the <tt>cJavaDSLProcessor</tt> with this simple command (note the leading ".", this is Camel Java DSL)

    .unmarshal().json(org.apache.camel.model.dataformat.JsonLibrary.Jackson, beans.JazzResponse.class)

The first parameter, is the fully qualified Class name of the Jackson library.  It can be shortened to just <tt>JsonLbirary.Jackson</tt> if you add an import statement in your cConfig.

    import org.apache.camel.model.dataformat.JsonLibrary;

The second parameter is the fully qualified name of your POJO class.

To **marshal** from POJO to JSON is even easier.  Just add the <tt>cJavaDSLProcessor</tt> as shown below:

    .marshal().json(JsonLibrary.Jackson)

Keep in mind that Camel has lots of syntactic sugar available in its DSL.  If you find yourself writing lots of code to use utility libraries take a second look in the documentation.

Here is a [sample JSON input file] used in a [Talend Studio route demonstrating JSON marshalling and unmarshalling with Jackson].  Import it with Import Items into the Studio _Mediation_ perspective.
